  ReversingLabs-developed AssemblyLine service for obtaining File Reputation, AV Scanner and File Analysis results from Spectra Intelligence.

# Regex defining the types of files the service accepts and rejects
accepts: .*
rejects: empty|metadata/.*

# At which stage the service should run (one of: FILTER, EXTRACT, CORE, SECONDARY, POST)
# NOTE: Stages are executed in the order defined in the list
stage: FILTER
# Which category the service is part of (one of: Antivirus, Dynamic Analysis, External, Extraction, Filtering, Networking, Static Analysis)
category: Filtering

# Does the service require access to the file to perform its task
# If set to false, the service will only have access to the file metadata (e.g. Hashes, size, type, ...)
file_required: true
# Maximum execution time the service has before it's considered to be timed out
timeout: 10
# Does the service force the caching of results to be disabled
# (only use for service that will always provided different results each run)
disable_cache: true

# is the service enabled by default
enabled: true
# does the service make APIs call to other product not part of the assemblyline infrastructure (e.g. VirusTotal, ...)
is_external: true
# Number of concurrent services allowed to run at the same time
licence_count: 0

# service configuration block (dictionary of config variables)
# NOTE: The key names can be anything and the value can be of any types
